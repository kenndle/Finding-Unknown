The project the group has created is an outer space shooter game. The player is a villain that throughout the game
is trying to find out who he is.  This game was created using C++ and the Raylib graphic library.  With this 
implementation our group was able to create a player that is moveable and can shoot at oncoming targets with a moving
screen.  The graphics in the game are original and creative. This part of are project was extremely innovative since our graphic designer
had to create these by hand and with this had to use original thought and design skills.  As we look into the code of our program we have
some extremely complex code. One of these being the code to move players. It is created not to know which specific button is pushed but
rather when the button for up is pushed. This allows a programmer at any time to go in and switch the key for up without a problem.
