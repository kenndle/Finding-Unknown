Evaluation Results
Evaluating the program that my group has created it is clear to see that we have been able to implement almost everything we have set out 
to create.
+ This game also allows users to use the space bar to shoot their enemies and ASDW keys to move the space ship.
  + We have not been able to implement a device to control movement but that is something that will be added later on in the development.
+ The programmers have created a game using C++ and the Raylib graphics library. The graphics library works well with the
game as well as graphics that our group has created.
+ The collison detection is accurate to a point. It detects collison in a scope of an area and can detect the collison.
+ We have not been able to save files into a JSON file. We have levels in a text file instead.
+ The project has stayed the same since the original plan. We have added more of a storyoutline to our game but 
overall the thought of the game is the same.
+ There is a story to the game. Our title is finding unknown. The player is a villain who is trying to find out
who he is throughout the whole game.
+ We have not been able to implement upgrades into the game yet. The plan is to have the players ship upgrade after
every couple of levels.
+ There are mutliple levels to the game. AN arcade mode has not been implemented yet into the game.    
+This is a secure game as it is a functioning desk top application. 
  +Since it is not being moved into an internet application it is very secure.  
+ The enemies are planned during the creation of a level from a text file.

Project Critique
This project overall was completed efficently and my group was able to implement almost everything that we had set out
to implement.  The few things we were not able to implement were the gamepad control and an arcade mode for the game.
We decided to use a txt file isntead of a json file for game saveage. The coding to create this game was not simple
by any means.  Collison detection and the implementation of key usage and shooting can become complex.  This portion
of the code was difficult to implement as well as some of the design aspects. My group created orginal artwork for the game.
Our homescreen, enemies and character space ship are all originally and uniquely design. As a group we were able to work 
cohesively and function well to create a game that works well and is entertaining.
